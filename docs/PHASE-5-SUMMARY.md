# Phase 5: Scheduler Updates - COMPLETED

**Date Completed:** December 2024  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Phase:** 5 of 7  

## Overview
Phase 5 successfully updated the webhook scheduler to work with the new multi-device architecture, replacing the old hardcoded `pk01` approach with a scalable, device-aware scheduling system.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Multi-Device Webhook Scheduler ✅
**File:** `src/triggers/webhookScheduler.js`

#### **Key Features:**
- **Device Iteration**: Automatically processes all configured devices from `config.ENV.DEVICES`
- **Concurrency Control**: Processes devices in configurable batches (default: 3 concurrent)
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Exponential backoff with configurable retry attempts
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks response times, success rates, and device status
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Configurable intervals with overlap prevention

#### **Core Methods:**
- `init()` - Initialize scheduler and trigger initial webhooks
- `triggerWebhooksForAllDevices(webhookType, options)` - Process all devices
- `triggerDeviceWebhook(prefix, webhookType, options)` - Single device webhook
- `triggerWebhooksByCountry(countryCode, webhookType, options)` - Country-based filtering
- `triggerWebhooksForDevices(deviceIds, webhookType, options)` - Specific device selection
- `getStatus()` - Scheduler status and statistics

#### **Configuration Options:**
- `WEBHOOK_INTERVAL_MINUTES` - Interval between scheduled runs (default: 15)
- `MAX_CONCURRENT_DEVICES` - Maximum devices processed simultaneously (default: 3)
- `WEBHOOK_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` - Retry attempts for failed webhooks (default: 3)
- `WEBHOOK_RETRY_DELAY_MS` - Base delay between retries (default: 5000ms)

### 2. Enhanced Configuration ✅
**File:** `src/config/index.js`

#### **New Webhook Scheduler Configuration:**
```javascript
const WEBHOOK_SCHEDULER = {
    DEFAULT_INTERVAL_MINUTES: 15,    // Default interval
    MAX_CONCURRENT_DEVICES: 3,       // Concurrency limit
    MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS: 3,           // Retry attempts
    RETRY_DELAY_MS: 5000,            // Base retry delay
    EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF: true,       // Exponential backoff
    REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS: 30000,       // Request timeout
    LOG_DETAILED_RESULTS: true,      // Detailed logging
    TRACK_DEVICE_RESULTS: true,      // Result tracking
    ENABLE_METRICS: true             // Performance metrics
};
```

### 3. New API Server ✅
**File:** `src/api-server.js`

#### **Architecture Integration:**
- **New Route Structure**: Uses all new controllers and routes
- **Device-Aware Logging**: Logs include device prefix for better tracking
- **Scheduler Integration**: Automatically initializes multi-device webhook scheduler
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup of scheduler and server resources
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for uncaught exceptions

#### **Route Mounting:**
```javascript
app.use('/', rootRoutes);        // Root and health endpoints
app.use('/', deviceRoutes);      // Device management
app.use('/', attendanceRoutes);  // Attendance endpoints
app.use('/', shiftRoutes);       // Shift endpoints
app.use('/', webhookRoutes);     // Webhook endpoints
```

### 4. Key Improvements Over Old Scheduler

#### **Old Scheduler (Single Device):**
- ❌ Hardcoded to `/attendance/webhook/todayShift`
- ❌ Only supported `pk01` device
- ❌ No concurrency controls
- ❌ No retry mechanisms
- ❌ No device iteration

#### **New Scheduler (Multi-Device):**
- ✅ **Device-Aware**: Automatically detects and processes all configured devices
- ✅ **Scalable**: Easy to add new devices without code changes
- ✅ **Concurrent**: Processes multiple devices simultaneously with controlled batching
- ✅ **Resilient**: Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- ✅ **Observable**: Detailed logging and performance metrics
- ✅ **Flexible**: Support for different webhook types and filtering options

### 5. Scheduler Workflow

#### **Initialization:**
1. **Server Start**: Scheduler initializes with all configured devices
2. **Initial Webhooks**: Triggers webhooks for all devices immediately
3. **Scheduled Runs**: Sets up periodic webhook calls every 15 minutes (configurable)

#### **Device Processing:**
1. **Device Discovery**: Reads device list from configuration
2. **Batch Processing**: Groups devices into configurable batches
3. **Concurrent Execution**: Processes each batch concurrently
4. **Result Tracking**: Monitors success/failure for each device
5. **Retry Logic**: Automatically retries failed webhooks

#### **Webhook Execution:**
1. **URL Construction**: Builds device-specific webhook URLs
2. **HTTP Requests**: Makes GET requests to device endpoints
3. **Response Handling**: Processes responses and tracks metrics
4. **Error Management**: Handles failures with retry logic

### 6. Testing Results ✅
All scheduler components were successfully tested:
- ✅ **Configuration Loading** - Environment variables and config parsing
- ✅ **Scheduler Instantiation** - Class creation and initialization
- ✅ **Status Tracking** - Running state and configuration access
- ✅ **Device Logic** - Device iteration and webhook URL construction
- ✅ **Utility Functions** - Array chunking and delay mechanisms
- ✅ **Control Methods** - Start/stop functionality

## Architecture Benefits Achieved

### **Scalability**
- **Automatic Device Detection**: New devices added via environment variables
- **Concurrent Processing**: Multiple devices processed simultaneously
- **Batch Processing**: Controlled resource usage with configurable batch sizes

### **Reliability**
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Overlap Prevention**: Prevents multiple scheduler runs from overlapping
- **Error Isolation**: Device failures don't affect other devices

### **Observability**
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times and success rates tracked
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time scheduler status and statistics

### **Maintainability**
- **Configuration-Driven**: All settings configurable via environment variables
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Consistent Patterns**: Follows established architecture patterns

## Next Steps
**Phase 6: Observability & Hardening** is next, which involves:
- **Health Endpoints**: Device health monitoring and status reporting
- **Metrics Collection**: Performance metrics and usage statistics
- **Logging Enhancement**: Structured logging with correlation IDs
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- **Performance Optimization**: Response time optimization and caching

## Files Modified/Created
- ✅ `src/triggers/webhookScheduler.js` - New multi-device scheduler
- ✅ `src/config/index.js` - Added webhook scheduler configuration
- ✅ `src/api-server.js` - New API server with scheduler integration

## Summary
Phase 5 successfully transformed the webhook scheduler from a single-device, hardcoded system to a scalable, multi-device automation engine. The new scheduler automatically detects all configured devices, processes them concurrently with controlled resource usage, and provides comprehensive monitoring and error handling.

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ **Multi-Device Support**: Automatically processes all configured devices
- ✅ **Concurrency Control**: Configurable batch processing with overlap prevention
- ✅ **Retry Mechanisms**: Resilient webhook delivery with exponential backoff
- ✅ **Performance Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics and status tracking
- ✅ **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new devices without code changes

**Ready to proceed to Phase 6: Observability & Hardening**
