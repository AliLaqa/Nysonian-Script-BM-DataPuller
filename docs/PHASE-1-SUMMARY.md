# Phase 1: Baseline & Setup - COMPLETED

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Environment & Configuration âœ…
- Created `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md` with standardized multi-device env template
- Defined prefix-based configuration schema (`pk01_*`, `us01_*`, etc.)
- Documented server, device, N8N webhook, and scheduler settings

### 2. Target Folder Structure âœ…
- Created complete `src/` directory structure:
  ```
  src/
  â”œâ”€â”€ config/           # Configuration files
  â”œâ”€â”€ routes/           # Express route definitions
  â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/      # HTTP controllers
  â”œâ”€â”€ services/         # Business logic
  â”œâ”€â”€ devices/          # Device adapters
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ zk/          # ZKTeco device support
  â”œâ”€â”€ utils/            # Shared utilities
  â”œâ”€â”€ triggers/         # Scheduled tasks
  â””â”€â”€ index.js          # Main entry point
  ```

### 3. Route Inventory & Migration Mapping âœ…
- Created `docs/ROUTE-INVENTORY.md` with complete endpoint mapping
- Documented current routes vs. new device-scoped architecture
- Defined migration phases and implementation notes

### 4. Base Architecture Scaffolding âœ…
- Moved `config.js` to `src/config/index.js`
- Created placeholder files for all controllers, services, and routes
- Added TODO comments with planned function signatures
- Created main `src/index.js` export file

## Current Status

**Phase 1 is COMPLETE** - We now have:
- âœ… Clean, scalable folder structure
- âœ… Environment configuration template
- âœ… Complete route migration mapping
- âœ… Base architecture scaffolding
- âœ… No behavior changes to existing code

## Next Steps (Phase 2: Device Adapter)

The next phase will focus on migrating the device adapter:

1. **Move ZK Helper** - Migrate `utils/zkHelper.js` to `src/devices/zk/zkClient.js`
2. **Update Config Imports** - Fix import paths in moved config
3. **Test Structure** - Verify the new structure loads without errors
4. **Begin Service Implementation** - Start with basic device service functions

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md` - Environment configuration template
- `docs/ROUTE-INVENTORY.md` - Route migration mapping
- `docs/PHASE-1-SUMMARY.md` - This summary document
- `src/` - Complete new directory structure
- `src/index.js` - Main export file
- All controller, service, and route placeholder files

### Moved Files
- `config.js` â†’ `src/config/index.js`

### No Changes Made To
- Existing route files (still functional)
- Existing utility files (still functional)
- Runtime behavior (server still works the same)

## Ready for Phase 2

The foundation is now in place. We can proceed to Phase 2 (Device Adapter) where we'll:
- Migrate the ZK helper functionality
- Update import paths
- Begin implementing the actual business logic

**Status: READY TO PROCEED** ðŸš€
